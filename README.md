# JRD Electrical Ltd website
This was my first real-world project. I was commissioned by JRD Electrical to update their website and provide a site with a modern feel and pleasing aesthetics, while retaining all the important/essential content that was present on their existing website. 

# What I used:
•	React
•	JavaScript
•	CSS
•	SCSS
•	BEM
•	GitHub

# Design
I decided to create the website in React, splitting the homepage into numerous sections, showcasing the different areas that JRD Electrical work in as electricians. The design across the whole website is clean, with each page following the same format to provide consistency throughout.

# Functionality
•	The site itself is easy to navigate. Each of the sections on the homepage contain a button that redirect you to the contact page to get in touch for a quote. The navbar contains links to all the relevant sections, as well as a prominent "contact us" button.

•	Using react router dom, the website allows you to navigate to the pages Services, TrustMark, About Us and Contact us, with ease.

•	The Contact Us page allows the user to get in touch with JRD Electrical, whether that's via email, phone or the fully functional contact form.
